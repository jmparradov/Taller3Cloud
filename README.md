## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use AWS EMR and Apache Spark to process large datasets stored in a data lake. You will gain hands-on experience with data ingestion, transformation, and analysis using Spark.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- An AWS account with access to EMR
- Basic knowledge of Apache Spark and Python
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed and configured
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) installed

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-lake-processing-tutorial.git
    cd data-lake-processing-tutorial
    ```

2. **Launch an EMR Cluster**:
    Follow the instructions in the notebook to launch an EMR cluster with Spark installed.

3. **Upload the Notebook to EMR**:
    Upload the `data-lake-processing.ipynb` notebook to the EMR cluster.

4. **Configure S3 Buckets**:
    Set up the necessary S3 buckets to store your input data and output results. Update the paths in the notebook accordingly.

## Notebook Overview

The `data-lake-processing.ipynb` notebook covers the following topics:

1. **Data Ingestion**:
    - Reading data from various sources (e.g., S3, databases, APIs)
    - Storing data in the data lake

2. **Data Transformation**:
    - Using Spark SQL and DataFrame API for data cleaning and transformation
    - Writing transformed data back to the data lake

3. **Data Analysis**:
    - Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Spark
    - Generating summary statistics and visualizations

## Data Sources

For this tutorial, you can use publicly available datasets or your own data. Some recommended datasets include:

- [Amazon Customer Reviews Dataset](https://registry.opendata.aws/amazon-reviews/)
- [NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) Trip Record Data](https://registry.opendata.aws/nyc-tlc-trip-records/)

## Usage

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. **Open the Notebook**:
    Open the `data-lake-processing.ipynb` notebook in your browser.

3. **Run the Cells**:
    Follow the instructions in the notebook and run the cells to practice data lake processing with AWS EMR and Spark.
